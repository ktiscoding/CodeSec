To run the code, run main.py

Some of the other files support the running of this, some of the other files shows the iterative process that we went through to build our app.

Earlier code which was used to arrive at the final program includes:

- DatabaseCreation.py
- LogisticRegression.py
- camera.py
- camera2.py

Code which helps run main.py:

- app.kv
- keras_model.h5


The file MLmodel.py is a working machine learning algorithm we made, but is not used in the code.
